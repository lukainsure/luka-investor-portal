Check-out the review of your car by our friends at Cars.co.za - review I'd love to help you get it insured.\n\nLet me pull up your account. I can see you currently have your Stellenbosch and Buffels Bay home insured with us. You have two existing vehicles covered, your 2020 Toyota Prado VX and your daughter’s 2022 VW Polo TSI Comfortline .\n\nYour policy has been active since January 2023 and you've been claim-free for just over 26 months - excellent track record.\n\nThe current estimated value range determined with the help of our partners at We Buy Cars for your Prado is R750k - R825k, this means your insured value of R800k is right in the middle of this range. The Polo has a fair value estimate of R275k - R325, you have the car insured for R300k.\n\nTo get your Toyota Land Cruiser covered, I need a few details. What year, model and colour is it?"

Based on the 2026 Land Cruiser 300 VX at R1.75 million, your indicative monthly premium would be around R2,340.\n\nHow do your premium stack up - Now here's the good part - I've analysed 1,347 home and car insurance quotes generated by Hippo.co.za in the past 30 days by customers with profiles similar to yours (Western Cape, 45-55 years old, three vehicles, two properties, claim-free history). I have also cross referenced your profile against similar profiles who submitted competitor policy schedules before joining LUKA over the past 120 days.\n\nThe average premium on a similar vehicle and profile returned is R2,691 - you are thus saving 15% on the industry average or R4,212 annually!"
